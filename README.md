# Zeke-Bot Vers. 1.0, using Discord.py 2.0 

Motive: 
    The bulk of my coding experience came from Java, so I began building this bot as a means to work my way around Python and to formally acquire the langauge.  The commands I've presently added to the list of functionalities are a reflection of gaps in my programming skillset that I felt needed some illumination, including how to talk to a cloud database from a local program, web-scraping, etc.  

Working Tools: Discord 2.0 API, MongoDB, BS4

Help: endlessly wrangling api documentation, stackoverflow, and a thanks to my friend Ankit for teaching me about the databasing for this

## Current Features

  /math challenge your friends to a mental math game, view the current standings in a server leaderboard
  
  /henle uses the domain henle.de (visit for more info) to query for a musical piece (in categories such as Classical Piano)
  present on the site.  Pick a search result and receive info on the piece/suite inclusive of difficulty, biography, and more.
  
  /banter add taunts (text or embed) that are randomly generated when taunts are invoked by bot functions (remove func in-progress)
